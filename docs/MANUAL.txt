Welcome to the TBO manual! Hopefully this explains enough about TBO to make the game easy to understand and play.

*** Project History ***

I started planning this project in the spring of 2022 because I was frustrated with the fact that all of the main online tank shooters available today are pay-to-win. This project was essentially my attempt to change that. I am not quite sure that I succeeded, because although the game does not involve real money in any way, the game's server script is not built well enough that I would dare set up a public server with a published IP address. However, I had a lot of fun building this, learned a lot, and the project is at the point where I can play with a bunch of friends on a server if I don't tell everyone around the world my server IP. Anyways, I'm pretty burnt out from working on this for two years, but I might come back and improve the server script enough that it could be used for a public server...just not right now. I really hope you enjoy trying out what I have made!

*** Getting Started ***

First, download the game from Github (www.github.com/happyboomonster/Tank-Battalion-Online) if you do not already have the game files on DVD. Extract the game from the ZIP file you downloaded. Enter the "Tank Battalion Online" folder. If you did not download the game, insert your game DVD into your computer and open a file manager. Navigate to the contents of the DVD.

For those who know how to use Python 3, the game can be run in a Python 3 shell provided that the libraries mentioned in the README.txt document are installed. For those who do not know how or do not want to use Python, standard executable files have also been packaged with the game files in the main game folder. Simply find an executable file which has in its filename the same operating system that your computer uses, and matches your machine's word size (64-bit = x86_64, 32-bit = x86). Run it by double-clicking it. The game should start!

*** Setting up Online Mode ***

If you want to play online, you will need to create a game account. Either use WASD to move the crosshair and E to shoot/click, or use the mouse to click on "create account". You will need to type in the IP address of the server you want to connect to, as well as the username and password you want to have (WARNING: DO NOT USE A PASSWORD YOU USE FOR OTHER ACCOUNTS! See "security notice" below for more information). For future play sessions, click on "login" instead of "create account". Enter the server IP address and your account credentials just like you would if you were creating an account.

If everything worked properly, you will be greeted with a primitive menu with four options: Battle, Store, Settings, and Exit. At the bottom of the screen is a grey box. If you hover the crosshair over a menu option, a line of text may begin to scroll in the grey box which tells you something (hopefully) useful about that menu option. When you are not hovering the crosshair over a menu option, a line of text will scroll which tells you the current status of your tank (tank stats explained in "gameplay" and "complex game mechanics" below).

If everything did not work properly, you will get an error message. There are several reasons why this could happen:
 1) You typed the wrong password. Re-try logging in, but double-check you type your username and password correctly.
 2) Someone else is logged into the account currently. Are you sharing an account with someone else? Only one person can use an account at a time.
 3) You tried to create an account with a username which is already being used. Re-try with a different username.
 4) The first 3 letters of your account name were "bot". These letters are forbidden, as they are reserved for actual AI players ingame.
 5) The server is not working. Wait a few minutes and try again.

*** Store ***

The store is the most important part of the game outside of actual gameplay, because you must purchase tank shells to be able to shoot when ingame. You can buy or sell items by clicking on the "purchase mode" button to toggle between purchasing and refunding (NOTE: you only receive 75% of the cost of an item when you refund it) items, and then clicking on the item you want to buy/sell in the store. There are two currencies, ^ and EXP. Your currency balance is displayed near the top of the screen when you are in a store menu where an item is purchasable. All purchasable items are divided into four categories: Shells, Upgrades, Specialization, and Powerups.

There are four kinds of shells, each of which has unique characteristics. All shells have a base damage value, a base penetration value, and some shells will also ignite an enemy's fuel tank when the enemy is hit (burn away the health points of the enemy for several seconds). In the "shells" category of the store, each type of shell is displayed, along with how many the player owns and may own, the base damage and penetration of the shell (abbreviated "base d/p") and the cost of the shell. Base damage and penetration values will be explained in the "gameplay" section below. Hollow shells are the least expensive shell, but also deal a very small amount of damage and do not penetrate armor well. Regular shells are somewhat more expensive, but deal more damage and penetrate armor well enough for general use. Explosive shells are extremely expensive and do not penetrate armor well, but deal a large amount of damage and cause a fire in enemy fuel tanks, which slowly burns away the target's health points for several seconds after being hit. Disk shells deal more damage than regular shells but less than explosive shells, and penetrate armor better than any other shell in the game.

There are four kinds of upgrades: Gun, Loading Mechanism, Armor, and Engine. Gun increases the player tank's damage multiplier (abbreviated "d.m.") and penetration multiplier (abbreviated "p.m.; see "complex game mechanics" for more information). Loading Mechanism increases the player tank's firing rate by a certain amount of "rounds per minute" (abbreviated "RPM"). Armor increases the player tank's armor by a certain number (see "complex game mechanics" for more information). Engine increases the player's movement rate by a certain amount of tiles per second.

Specialization is essentially a strange way of upgrading your tank. You may not specialize your tank if you own shells, so you will need to sell those before trying to specialize your tank. Essentially what specialization allows you to do is sacrifice certain capabilities of your tank to improve others. "Specialize light" decreases your tank's damage multiplier and armor, but increases your tank's penetration multiplier, speed, and loading speed. "Specialize heavy" does the exact opposite. Please note, you can not specialize your tank further than "superheavy" or "superlight".

There are six powerups in the game. They are adequately described in the store menu, with a few exceptions. Fire extinguisher puts out any fire in your fuel tank (you can get fire in your fuel tank by being shot with explosive shells, for instance). Penetration is abbreviated as "pn." for amped gun, and explosive tip does not explicitly state that using it will make all shells you fire while it is active slowly burn away enemy health points by causing fire in enemy fuel tanks. Lastly, "extra armor" multiplies the player tank's current armor value by 1.50. If the player has no armor left, this powerup will essentially just slow the player down by 50%, and cost the player 12.5 * the player's damage multiplier ^. In other words, use this powerup when you have plenty of armor left or it will not benefit you at all!

*** Settings ***

I highly recommend going into the game settings and at least customizing your game controls. Movement (up/down/left/right), shooting, and the cursor modifier are by far the most important keys to configure since the rest can be pressed with a combination of the movement keys, the shoot key, and the cursor modifier key. Also, this game does support joysticks. Shoot the "kb/js" button, and if a joystick is connected, the game should recognize it. All configured keys will need to be reconfigured, since there is no simple way of automatically mapping a keyboard to a joystick.

This menu also allows modifying the graphical quality of explosion and fire effects in the game ("GFX quality"). Unless you want your computer to lag, DO NOT set this setting to 30 (max)! I have a gaming laptop and 30 makes my computer lag significantly. You can also change sound effect ("SFX volume") and music volume ("music volume"). These settings range between 0 (muted) and 10. Finally, you can also skip forward or backward one music track if you do not like the music currently playing in the lobby (NOTE: the game does not ship with any music; you will have to add some yourself).

*** Gameplay ***

At the main menu (the menu you see after logging in/creating a new account), click "battle". You will enter a new menu with an option called "battle type". Clicking this option will toggle the kind of battle you will enter between two types: "regular" and "experience" battles. For beginner players, I highly recommend starting with "regular" battles.

There are two differences between battle modes. The first is a gameplay difference. In "experience" mode, when neither you nor one of your teammates can establish line of sight with a given enemy tank or travel within 2.5 tiles of the enemy tank, the enemy tank will become "unspotted". This means that you will no longer see where the enemy tank is, but will rather see the last position of the tank where you established line of sight with it or were close enough to hear it (2.5 tiles distance). You will know when a tank has become unspotted because the tank will turn grey and stop moving. Furthermore, you will be able to see the enemy tank on your radar (located at the bottom-right corner of the screen) change from a bright red dot to a faded red dot. "Regular" mode allows players to always see enemy tanks, regardless of positioning. The second difference between battle modes is that "experience" battles allow players to earn EXP points (used to specialize your tank; see "store" above).

After choosing a battle mode and clicking "battle", you will be transported into the matchmaking queue. From here, you can scroll through the list of players currently waiting to get into a battle. Next to their name is a matchmaker rating. This number will give you a general idea of the power of a given player relative to yourself (just compare your own rating number to another player's rating number). Clicking on a player name will show you everything they own (which can be intimidating if they have everything in the game and you are starting from scratch). After waiting for a while, you will enter a game, even if there are no other players online (you'll be playing against AIs).

The goal of the game is simple: destroy all enemy teams without being destroyed (If neither of those two situations happen, the game timer, which is located at the bottom of the screen, may hit 0. This will result in a draw). The way you destroy them is also simple: shoot them. Obviously, pressing the "shoot" key (default: E) will make your tank fire a shell in the last non-diagonal direction your tank was facing, if one is loaded. However, do not waste shells! You have a limited amount. Also, your tank has a finite loading speed, so be careful about when you attack - the last thing you want is to advance your tank towards the enemy to attack, only to find you still have six seconds left of reloading before your next shot. You can see how many shells you have of each type and whether you are ready to fire at the top of your screen. A square picture of each type of shell is shown, starting with "hollow" shells on the left and ending with "disk" shells on the right. In a yellow font, the number of shells you own of each type is shown on top of the image of each shell type. Also, in a green font, the key you must press to load a specific type of shell into your tank barrel is also placed on top of the image of each shell type. If one of the characters which should be green is a red number, this means two things: First, the number is how many seconds you must wait until you have loaded a new shell into your tank barrel. Secondly, the shell image that the red number is on top of indicates the type of shell being loaded into your tank. When there is no red number left, your tank is ready to fire the type of shell you just loaded. You can load a different type of shell if you wish by clicking on the image of the shell you want with the mouse, holding down the "cursor modifier" button while using the movement keys to move the crosshair to the image of the shell you want and pressing "shoot" while still holding down the "cursor modifier" key, or pressing the key indicated in green on top of the image of the shell you want to load (NOTE: some non-alphanumeric keys are not displayed at all, so you may need to commit certain key configurations to memory). Please note, it will take two seconds to unload the current shell and load the new shell into your tank if you have already completed loading a shell.

Usually, shooting the game arena's walls is a waste of shells. However, there is one exception. Any wall which looks like a brick will be destroyed after being shot a number of times (the number of shots needed varies based on the shell used and the tank's damage and penetration multipliers). This can be useful at times if you are trapped and need to escape from enemy advances, or want to open a new attack path.

Your health bar is placed vertically along the far left side of the screen. A green health bar indicates that the player has armor left. Armor will absorb a number of hits without impacting the player tank's health. The only exception to this rule is shells which burn away tank health points, since armor can not be burned away. A red health bar indicates that the player has no armor left and the tank's health points will be directly affected by shells instead of the armor.

You may want to attempt to defend your flag (spawn location), since every 20 seconds a powerup or ammunition refill will spawn. If you or your teammates do not take it, an enemy could take it instead.

Your radar is located at the bottom-right corner of your screen. It shows you where tanks are, where shells, explosions, fires, and powerups are, and where sound effects are coming from. Sound effect positions and explosions or fires are displayed as purple clusters of dots. Spotted enemies are bright red dots, while spotted players on your team are bright green dots. Unspotted enemy players are dim red dots, while unspotted team players are dim green dots. Powerups are displayed as yellow dots. Since friendly fire is disabled in this game, shells fired by a player on your team are displayed as a blue dot, while shells fired by an enemy are displayed as an orange dot.

The game has six powerups, which are represented by square images along the left side of the player's screen. All powerup effects last for 15 seconds, and all powerups take 15 seconds to recharge before they can be reused. When a powerup is not available (because you have not purchased it), a red X will be overlaid on its image ingame. If it is available for use, either no symbol will be overlaid on its image, or a green character will be overlaid on its image which indicates the key the player must press to activate it. Alternatively, the cursor modifier, direction, and shoot buttons or the mouse can be used to click on it in the same fashion as for selecting shells. If it is currently in use, the powerup image will have a yellow number overlaid on it which shows the number of seconds before the powerup becomes inactive. After a powerup becomes inactive, a red number is overlaid on its image. This number shows how many seconds you will have to wait before you can reuse a powerup. The function of each powerup is described in detail in the store (see "store" above).

*** Complex Game Mechanics ***

The game decides how players are damaged based on shell base penetration and base damage (these values can be found in the store; see "store" above), as well as the player tank's armor value, damage multiplier, and penetration multiplier (these values can be found in the grey text box in the main menu; see "getting started" above).
 1) When a player is hit by a shell and has no armor left, the damage dealt to the player's HP is: the shell base damage * the enemy (who shot the shell) tank's damage multiplier
 2) When a player is hit by a shell and has armor left, the damage dealt to the player's armor is: the shell base damage * the enemy (who shot the shell) tank's damage multiplier * (the shell base penetration * the enemy (who shot the shell) tank's penetration multiplier) / the player's armor (NOTE: If the player tank takes more damage than the tank has armor, the tank's armor is set to 0 but no HP is lost).
 
The game decides which shell wins in a collision based on shell base penetration and base damage, as well as the player tank's damage multiplier and penetration multiplier. Shells move at their penetration value / 4.75 tiles per second. As such, a shell with 0 penetration would mean a shell which does not move. What the game essentially does is treat shell penetration values as the armor of a shell. Shells do not have an HP value, so when their armor is depleted, they are instantly destroyed (NOTE: a tank can be destroyed by burning away its HP while it still has armor). Treat shell collisions like tanks being shot by shells, except both take damage in this case.

^ is earned in the game by dealing more damage than you spent on powerups and ammunition. Hollow shells, for example, cost 0.5 * the player tank's damage multiplier ^, but deal 7 * the player tank's damage multiplier ^. This means that if the player tank had a damage multiplier of 1 and shot an enemy which had no armor, the player would spend 0.5^ on ammunition, but earn 7^ in damage before rebuying the hollow shell. Net, the player would earn 6.5^. Do this math for all the other shells, and you will find that regular shells can earn money, but less than hollow shells. Disk and explosive shells do not earn money, except for when you let the explosive shell deal maximal damage (shooting a tank with no armor) and the enemy tank does not extinguish that fire. You may also notice that earnings from shooting shells decrease sharply and even become negative for shooting enemies with large amounts of armor. Also, the amount of money earned or lost from shooting a shell correlates with the damage multiplier of the player tank. For example, shooting a hollow shell from a tank with a damage multiplier of 2 at a player with no armor will result in 14^ earned from damage, and 1^ lost from rebuying the shell. Net, 13^ is earned, which is nearly double the 6.5^ earned from the same shot from a tank with a damage multiplier of 1. Remember that powerup costs also must be subtracted from player earnings, each of which costs 12.5 * the player's damage multiplier ^. Lastly, dying will make the player lose 62.5^, while getting a kill will make the player gain 25^.

EXP is earned in the game by dealing damage, killing enemies, and consistently landing the shots you take on an enemy rather than a wall (an exception is bricks, since breaking them is intended). When you die, you lose 25 EXP. When you miss a shot, you lose 5 EXP (shooting a brick does not count as a miss). When you hit a shot, you gain 1 EXP. When you kill someone, you gain 10 EXP. Lastly, every 40 damage a player deals, the player earns 1 EXP.

The "extra armor" powerup behaves differently from other powerups. It increases your tank's current armor by 50% upon activation, and then decreases your tank's armor by 50% upon deactivation. The result of this is that it can marginally decrease the damage a player receives from hits taken. For example, if a player has 20 armor and uses extra armor before being hit by a stock hollow shell (8 damage, 8 penetration), the player will have 30 armor before being hit. The player will be left with 30 armor - 8 damage * 8 penetration / 30 armor ~= 28 armor. Upon the deactivation of the powerup, the player will have ~18.6 armor. If the player had not used Extra Armor before being hit, the player would be left with ~16.8 armor. Usage of this powerup is especially helpful with tanks that have a lot of armor (tanks with lots of armor upgrades and/or heavy tanks).

*** Offline Mode ***

Offline mode works the same way online mode works, but allows multiple players via split-screen on one computer, and gives the player more control over the game settings. In particular, the player can choose the map which will be used, the amount of ^ (money) and EXP everyone starts with, and the number of bots present in the match. Furthermore, the bot difficulty can be adjusted from 1 (fish in a barrel) to 20 (do not get hit). Please note, player settings can not be changed after entering the game's "main menu".

*** Changing/Adding Game Music ***

All music files for TBO are stored in "sfx/music" (relative path from the TBO base folder). Remove or add sound files to the "ingame", "lobby", or "queue" folders. These sound files will be played as background music in the game lobby/queue/main game loop. Please note, use the WAV sound format for best OS compatibility (e.g. Windows doesn't seem to ship with a library to play mp3s by default, so the game will crash unless you have mpg123 installed. Tested on Windows 7 Home Edition).

*** Privacy Notice ***

Any unmodified TBO servers you connect to do not collect any information from you except your username, password, and game settings. The only information stored about you is your username, password, game settings, amount of currencies owned (^, EXP), and any items you have purchased (e.g. upgrades, tank specialization, shells).

*** Security Notice ***

I have not encrypted passwords or usernames, and the server is not programmed very well. This means your password and username could be stolen by hackers. As such, please do not use a password which is shared with another account. Furthermore, it is possible that hackers could infect a TBO server with a virus which could in turn infect your own machine. Please make sure you can trust the TBO servers you connect to! I take no responsibility for if any computers are compromised, or if any passwords or usernames are stolen.
