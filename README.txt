To play the game, simply start the "Tank Battalion Online.py" script with Python 3!
Alternatively, if you do not have Python 3 or do not want to use it, use one of the executables contained in the same folder as this README document. Run it!
For more information on how to play, a game manual is located inside the "docs" folder.
If you want to host your own TBO server, since there is no official game server, there is more info on that in a document inside the "docs" folder.

Make sure you have the following libraries installed for it to work:
	Pygame v1.9.2 or later (earlier versions could work; I have not tested them however)
	pickle
	sys
	os
	_thread
	socket
	time
	random
	math

Also, the game MUST be run using Python 3! (just don't try 2.x, 3 runs faster anyways...)

Have fun! (hopefully there are no more bugs left in the game)
