TL;DR:
	To play the game, simply start the "Tank Battalion Online.py" script with Python 3!
	Alternatively, use one of the executables contained in the same folder as this README document. Run it!
	For more information on how to play, a game manual is located inside the "docs" folder.
	If you want to host your own TBO server, since there is no official game server, there is more info on that in a document inside the "docs" folder.
	REDUCE YOUR SCREEN RESOLUTION IF YOUR FRAMERATE IS TOO LOW!

System Requirements:
	- OS:
		- TBO_Windows_x86_64: Windows 10+. Sometimes Win10 apps can run on earlier versions; I have managed to get the game to start on Windows 7.
		- TBO_Windows_x86: Windows XP or newer. You'll probably need Service Pack 3 installed, although I am not 100% sure.
		- TBO_Linux_x86_64: Debian 11+ or equivalent. Basically you just have to have a LIBC version that is the same or newer than Debian 11's LIBC.
		- TBO_Linux_x86: Debian 12+ or equivalent. Same as above ^^
	- CPU:	Minimum: Anything that runs Python 3 and Pygame (I've done it on a Pentium 4).
		20FPS: ~2.0 GHz clock speed, with at least 3 cores
		60FPS: I get *close* to 60 FPS at 1920x1080 with an Intel Core i5-10500H.
		Recommended: As fast as you can afford...I did what I could to optimise the game, but...Python isn't exactly a fast programming language.
	- GPU:	CAN IT RUN PAINT???
	- RAM:	I have tested that the game runs with 512 MB of RAM on Windows XP. Maybe even 256 MB could work on a lightweight operating system?

If you are running the game via Python:
	- Make sure you have Pygame installed! The earliest version I have tested is 1.7.1, which worked fine.
	- Also, the game MUST be run using Python 3! (just don't try 2.x, 3 runs faster anyways...)

Have fun! (hopefully there are no more bugs left in the game)
