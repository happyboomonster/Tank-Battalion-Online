### - Brief demo program of how to use this library effectively -
##screen = pygame.display.set_mode([200,200])
##player_1_controls = Controls(8, "kb") #keyboard player
##for x in range(0,8): #configure all controls
##    print("Configure button " + str(x))
##    while not player_1_controls.configure_key(x):
##        get_keys()
##    pygame.time.delay(350)
##    get_keys()
##while True:
##    get_keys() #grab all keys pressed
##    print(player_1_controls.get_input())
##
##    pygame.time.delay(500) #I don't want to kill IDLE from printing too much...LOL
