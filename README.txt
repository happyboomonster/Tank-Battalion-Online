To play the game, simply start the "Tank Battalion Online.py" script!
Make sure you have the following libraries installed for it to work:
	Pygame v2.0 or later
	Pickle
	Sys
	_thread
	socket
	time
	random
	math
Also, the game MUST be run using Python 3! (just don't try 2.x, 3 runs faster anyways...)

Have fun! (hopefully there are no more bugs left in the game)
